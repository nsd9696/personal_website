                        In the process of adapting to a new environment and working with new people, we experience many moments of diversity. It is not always easy to discuss and accept the opinions of people from various environments, but it is essential in today’s global climate. I developed my capacity for diversity through my experience of collaborating with people from all over the world and managing individuals with different interests and points of view.
                     </p>
                    <p>
                        My first such experience was writing an essay with my Chinese friends. I worked extensively with Chinese students who were in Korea to study while participating in the Korea-China Leaders Forum. I helped them assimilate into Korean daily life and as a case in point, I have helped him find a suitable studio apartment. Moreover, my time with them allowed me to have a rich experience of understanding different cultures and sharing different perspectives on education under the essay assignment "Educational Exchange System between Korea and China."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This initial exposure helped me better adapt to a global company, Intel. As part of the AI Engineering team, I collaborated with teams from Hong Kong, Russia, and the United Kingdom. The experience was eye-opening in a way, as I learned about their rich cultures, work approach, and varied perspectives. In particular, while I mainly focused on how to change the component with brief codes, other teammates from the UK meticulously considered the justification of the codes from their team’s viewpoint. We closely discussed compromising each different perspective and we could successfully wrap up the issue. It was good practice for teamwork and the efficient exchange of ideas through good communication.                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being part of a diverse team is one thing, leading one is another. I have experience managing more than 160 students while working as the president of BOAZ, a large data club in Korea. The students had different interests and majors, so it was challenging to attend to their various needs while organizing the curriculum. My biggest adjustment was when we were in the process of creating a new data engineering group. Planning and forming the group, I had to accumulate opinions not only from the people who are interested in engineering but also from the other groups' people, as building a novel team can influence BOAZ’s overall schedule and curriculum. I went the extra mile to find a middle ground between the existing configuration and the new change and after much work. As a result, I was able to do it, and the experience taught me to become detail-oriented and more integrated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I am working on a team project for an “information security class” with an international student from Indonesia. He is still not good at Korean and programming, so he has particular difficulty when conducting practical training in class. I always sit next to him and help him understand and carry out the contents of the practice. For instance, I have guided him in English so that he can understand and practice arp-protocol during arp-spoofing practice. Furthermore, I am communicating the team project in English so that he can understand it as well and participate without difficulty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Tolerant" is a representative word that can be used to describe me. I welcome all forms of thought and listen with an open mind. I love being around people from all walks of life and all corners of the globe. I am exhilarated by the creativity and freshness each one can bring. I thrive in this environment and look forward to what these global collaborations can bring.
                    </p>
